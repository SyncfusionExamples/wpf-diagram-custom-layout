# Visualize a Custom Graph Layout Using Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout Engine in WPF Diagram
[Diagram](http://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfdiagram/) for WPF has some built-in, [automatic layouts](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfdiagram/automatic-layouts) to arrange nodes based on their relationships. Currently, we have three standard layouts [hierarchical tree layout](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfdiagram/automatic-layouts#hierarchical-tree-layout), [radial tree layout](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfdiagram/automatic-layouts#hierarchical-tree-layout), and [organizational layout](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/sfdiagram/automatic-layouts#organization-layout). If these layouts are not enough, you can use any other third-party or open-source layout engine for arrangements and you can use diagram’s visualization and other cool features. [Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout (MSAGL)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-automatic-graph-layout/) has advanced layouts in its layout engine. In this blog, we’ll see how to use this layout engine and visualize a layout using Syncfusion’s diagram control. Following are some sample graphs rendered using the MSAGL layout engine.
